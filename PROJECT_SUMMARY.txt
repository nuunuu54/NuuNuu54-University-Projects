ANSWERED QUESTIONS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Q: What is the purpose of the fix/dry-run-tests branch?
A: The fix/dry-run-tests was a development branch created to build the
   dry-run feature incrementally. Once the feature was complete, it was
   merged into Server-Admin-Project. Since both branches now point to
   the same commit (identical content), the fix/dry-run-tests branch 
   became redundant and has been DELETED from both local and remote.

   Purpose of such branches in general:
   - Feature isolation during development
   - Allows testing without affecting main project branch
   - Can have PR review before merging
   - Keeps history of feature development
